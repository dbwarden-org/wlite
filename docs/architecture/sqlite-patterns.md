# SQLite Patterns

wlite implements the same SQLite patterns as dbwarden. This page explains each pattern, why it exists, and when it triggers.

## Table rebuilds

### Why rebuilds exist

SQLite's `ALTER TABLE` is limited. It can rename a table, add a column, or rename a column (SQLite 3.25+). That is all. It cannot change a column type, change nullability, modify a default, drop a column (until 3.35), or alter constraints.

When you need to do any of these, you must rebuild the table: create a new table with the correct schema, copy the data, drop the old table, and rename the new one.

### When rebuilds trigger

A rebuild is triggered when any of these change:

| Change | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Column type | `TEXT` to `INTEGER` |
| Column nullability | `NULL` to `NOT NULL` |
| Column default | `DEFAULT 0` to `DEFAULT 1` |
| Column generated | Adding a generated column |
| Primary key | Adding or changing the PK |
| Unique constraint | Adding or removing UNIQUE |
| Check constraint | Adding or changing a CHECK |
| Foreign key | Adding or changing a REFERENCES |
| STRICT mode | Enabling or disabling STRICT |
| WITHOUT ROWID | Enabling or disabling WITHOUT ROWID |

### When rebuilds do NOT trigger

These changes use SQLite's `ALTER TABLE` directly:

| Change | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Add a column | `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` |
| Drop a column | `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN` (SQLite 3.35+) |
| Rename a table | `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO` |
| Rename a column | `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN` (SQLite 3.25+) |
| Add an index | `CREATE INDEX` |
| Drop an index | `DROP INDEX` |

### Rebuild SQL

A table rebuild generates this sequence:

```sql
-- 1. Disable foreign key checks
PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;

-- 2. Create staging table with correct schema
CREATE TABLE _staging_users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- 3. Copy data from old table
INSERT INTO _staging_users (id, name, email, created_at)
SELECT id, name, email, created_at FROM users;

-- 4. Drop old table
DROP TABLE users;

-- 5. Rename staging to final name
ALTER TABLE _staging_users RENAME TO users;

-- 6. Recreate indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS users_email ON users (email);

-- 7. Re-enable foreign key checks
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

### Data preservation

During a rebuild, wlite preserves all data. The `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` copies every row. If a new NOT NULL column is added without a DEFAULT, wlite uses a reasonable fallback:

| Column type | Fallback value |
|-------------|----------------|
| `INTEGER` | `0` |
| `REAL` | `0.0` |
| `TEXT` | `''` (empty string) |
| `BLOB` | `X''` (empty blob) |
| `BOOLEAN` | `0` |
| `DATETIME` | `''` (empty string) |

## Collapse logic

### The problem

If you change two things about a table in the same migration (e.g., change a column type AND add a new column), a naive tool would rebuild the table twice. That is wasteful and slow.

### The solution

wlite collapses multiple rebuilds on the same table into a single rebuild. The collapse happens during the planning stage, after the diff is computed.

### Example

```
-- Model changes:
--   1. field name text  -->  field name text { not_null }
--   2. add field bio text

-- Without collapse (2 rebuilds):
CREATE TABLE _staging_users (...) AS SELECT ...;
DROP TABLE users;
ALTER TABLE _staging_users RENAME TO users;
CREATE TABLE _staging_users (...) AS SELECT ...;
DROP TABLE users;
ALTER TABLE _staging_users RENAME TO users;

-- With collapse (1 rebuild):
CREATE TABLE _staging_users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    bio TEXT
) AS SELECT id, name FROM users;
DROP TABLE users;
ALTER TABLE _staging_users RENAME TO users;
```

### When collapse does NOT apply

- Changes to different tables are never collapsed
- Adding a column (without other changes) does not trigger a rebuild, so there is nothing to collapse
- Drops and rebuilds on the same table are handled separately

## Type normalization

### Why normalization exists

SQLite stores types as strings and uses affinity rules. The type `INT` and the type `INTEGER` are the same thing to SQLite, but a naive diff tool would see them as different and trigger an unnecessary migration.

wlite normalizes types before comparison so equivalent types do not trigger migrations.

### Normalization rules

| Input type | Normalized to | Reason |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| `INT`, `INT2`, `INT4`, `INT8` | `INTEGER` | INTEGER affinity |
| `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `SMALLINT`, `TINYINT` | `INTEGER` | INTEGER affinity |
| `UNSIGNED INT`, `SIGNED`, `MEDIUMINT` | `INTEGER` | INTEGER affinity |
| `BOOLEAN`, `BOOL` | `INTEGER` | SQLite stores booleans as 0/1 |
| `REAL`, `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT` | `REAL` | REAL affinity |
| `NUMERIC`, `DECIMAL` | `REAL` | REAL affinity |
| `TEXT`, `VARCHAR`, `CHARACTER` | `TEXT` | TEXT affinity |
| `CLOB`, `NATIVE CHARACTER` | `TEXT` | TEXT affinity |
| `BLOB` | `BLOB` | No normalization |
| `DATE`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP` | `TEXT` | SQLite stores dates as text |
| `UUID`, `JSON` | `TEXT` | Custom types stored as text |
| Anything else | preserved as-is | Arbitrary type names |

### Example

```sql
-- Model says:  field age INTEGER
-- Database:    age INT

-- wlite sees these as equivalent. No migration generated.
```

```sql
-- Model says:  field age INTEGER
-- Database:    age REAL

-- wlite sees a type change. Migration generated:
-- CREATE TABLE _staging (...) AS SELECT ...;
-- DROP TABLE ...;
-- ALTER TABLE _staging RENAME TO ...;
```

## Default handling

### Semantic comparison

Default values are compared semantically, not textually. These pairs are equivalent:

| Value A | Value B | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | `current_timestamp` | Case-insensitive |
| `CURRENT_DATE` | `current_date` | Case-insensitive |
| `CURRENT_TIME` | `current_time` | Case-insensitive |
| `0` | `FALSE` | Boolean coercion |
| `1` | `TRUE` | Boolean coercion |
| `'text'` | `"text"` | String quoting |
| `NULL` | `null` | Case-insensitive |

### When defaults trigger rebuilds

Changing a default value does NOT trigger a rebuild in most cases. SQLite supports `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT` in recent versions. wlite uses this when available.

A rebuild is only triggered if the default change is combined with other changes that require a rebuild (type change, nullability change, etc.).

## Constraint diffing

### Primary keys

Primary keys are compared column-by-column. If the columns in the primary key change, a rebuild is triggered.

```sql
-- Model:  primary_key (id)
-- DB:     PRIMARY KEY (id, name)
-- Result: rebuild to change PK
```

### Unique constraints

Unique constraints are compared by their column sets. Adding or removing a unique constraint triggers a rebuild.

```sql
-- Model:  unique (user_id, email)
-- DB:     (no unique constraint)
-- Result: rebuild to add UNIQUE (user_id, email)
```

### Foreign keys

Foreign keys are compared by their target table, target column, and actions (ON DELETE, ON UPDATE). Any change triggers a rebuild.

```sql
-- Model:  references User.id on delete cascade
-- DB:     references User.id on delete restrict
-- Result: rebuild to change FK action
```

### Check constraints

Check constraints are compared by their expression. Any change triggers a rebuild.

```sql
-- Model:  check (end_time > start_time)
-- DB:     check (end_time >= start_time)
-- Result: rebuild to change CHECK expression
```

## STRICT mode

When a model has the `strict` option, wlite generates:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
) STRICT;
```

STRICT mode enforces that every column must have a type and that values match the declared type. Enabling or disabling STRICT triggers a rebuild.

## WITHOUT ROWID

When a model has the `without rowid` option, wlite generates:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    user_id INTEGER,
    key TEXT,
    value TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, key)
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

WITHOUT ROWID tables are smaller and faster for tables with a composite primary key and no integer primary key. Enabling or disabling WITHOUT ROWID triggers a rebuild.

## Partial indexes

Partial indexes include a `WHERE` clause that limits which rows are indexed:

```
index active_users {
    on users(email)
    where active = true
}
```

Generates:

```sql
CREATE INDEX active_users ON users (email) WHERE active = true;
```

Partial indexes are smaller and faster because they only index rows matching the WHERE clause.

## Generated columns

Generated columns are computed from an expression. They can be stored (computed on write) or virtual (computed on read).

```
field search_name text {
    generated (lower(name)) stored
}
```

Generates:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN search_name TEXT AS (lower(name)) STORED;
```

Changing a generated column's expression or type triggers a rebuild.

## What wlite does NOT do

- **Data transformations**: wlite only changes schema, not data. If you rename a column, the data is preserved. If you change a type, the data is copied as-is.
- **Backups**: wlite does not back up your database before migration. Use your own backup strategy.
- **Incremental migrations**: each migration is the full diff from current state to desired state. There is no chain of revision scripts.
- **Migration history**: the schema state is the source of truth. wlite does not track which migrations have been applied.
- **Data validation**: wlite does not validate that existing data matches new constraints. If you add `NOT NULL` to a column with existing NULLs, the rebuild will use a fallback value.
